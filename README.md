‚îÇ   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [...categories]/
|   |   |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [category]/
|   |   |       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [...page].astro
‚îÇ   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [...tags]/

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

<br>

### Configuration

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Example",

  origin: "https://example.com",
  basePathname: "/", // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example

  title: "Example - This is the homepage title of Example",
  description: "This is the homepage description of Example",

  googleAnalyticsId: false, // or "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
  googleSiteVerificationId: false // or some value,
};

export const BLOG = {
  disabled: false,
  postsPerPage: 4,

  blog: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: 'blog', // blog main path, you can change this to "articles" (/articles)
  },

  post: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: '', // empty for /some-post, value for /pathname/some-post 
  },

  category: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: 'category', // set empty to change from /category/some-category to /some-category
  },

  tag: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: 'tag', // set empty to change from /tag/some-tag to /some-tag
  },
};


```
